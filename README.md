Analyzed soda bottling production line data. Identified key causes of downtime, enabling targeted improvements in operational efficiency.

## Key Insights
- Operators were the leading cause of downtime.
- Mac's downtime is mainly due to batch changes, while other operators struggle with machine adjustments.
- Five factors cause 80% of downtime; three are linked to operator errors.
- Mac's efficiency is slightly below the overall average of all operators.

## Recommendation
1. Provide batch change training for Mac and machine adjustment training for other operators.
2. Leverage preventive maintenance schedules to minimize or predict machine failure.
3. Upgrade or replace aging equipment with high downtime (need more data to ascertain age of equipment).
4. Implement real-time tracking systems or forecasting methods to maintain optimal stock levels.
